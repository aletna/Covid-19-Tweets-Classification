# Covid-19-Tweets-Classification

This tutorial makes use of 3 cleaned data sets, which can be found here: https://github.com/viethoangtranduong/covid19-tweets

- Dimension reduced sentiment data of 1,600,000 tweets labelled 0 for negative and 1 for positive sentiment.
- 8,981 unseen tweets about covid-19.
- Dimension reduced version of the 8,981 covid-19 tweets.

The goal is to train a LDA model on the sentiment data and use that model to predict the sentiment of each covid-19 tweet.
